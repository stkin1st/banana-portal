        <h1>The Story</h1>
        <div class="sub">A watercolor banana, a late-night rabbit hole, and a browser full of fruit.</div>

        <p>One night last year I got bored and painted a banana with watercolor at my kitchen table. I peeled a sticker off a real banana and stuck it on the painting.</p>

        <p>I cut the banana out of the watercolor paper, snapped a picture, and taped it on my fridge where it has lived ever since.</p>

        <p>Last week I was going through old photos on my phone and came across the banana. I thought, ‚ÄúI really love that banana.‚Äù So I went over to Staples and printed the picture to see what it would look like on paper. When it came out of the printer, I thought, "Wow, I think I love this banana more than anything in the world."</p>

        <p>So I went to the dollar store across the street and bought a picture frame for $5 and put the freshly printed banana into the frame. It looked so cool I drove around to all the dollar stores in Guelph, looking for more of the same frames‚ÄîI came up with 10 more.</p>

        <p>I went back to Staples, printed 10 more bananas, and put them into the frames.</p>

        <p>So for no particular reason, I now have a box of bananas sitting in my living room that I love more than anything.</p>

        <p>Over the weekend I was staring at the box of bananas and I wondered, "What else could I do with that banana?"</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, I had recently heard about a coding platform called Replit that I was curious about trying‚Äîthe idea being that anyone who doesn‚Äôt have a programming background (me) can use natural language to build software.</p>

        <p>So I created a free Replit account, opened a new window with ChatGPT, and started tinkering.</p>

        <p>I hadn‚Äôt planned to build anything‚Äîjust poke around. But then something weird happened.</p>
        
        <p>Something‚Ä¶<i>magical.</i></p>

        <p>I fell into a banana portal.</p>

        <p>Time faded and suddenly there was bananas everywhere.</p>

        <p>Hundreds of bananas‚Äîspinning, jittering, melting, wobbling, leaping.</p>

        <p>Bananas that undulate, oscillate, pulsate and squish with sine-based scaling. <i>Hours</i> of conversation about trick logic, event triggers, bounce physics, elastic collisions, friction damping, gravity and lateral drift simulation.</p>

        <p><b>My <i>god!</i></b></p>

        <p>Some bananas even became <i>hero jumpers</i> with boosted super-arc acrobatic energy that have a 3% chance per frame of launching across the screen based on their <i>cooldown state.</i></p>

        <p>I entered the banana portal with a vague idea and about six hours later I reemerged with my first ever app. A digital creation that came about exactly the same way as the watercolor banana from which it was built.</p>

        <p>This was an idea that would have otherwise remained trapped in my mind forever, too technically impractical to be expressed by someone who hasn‚Äôt developed years of specialized skills, and it was brought into existence in less than half a day with nothing but a standard English vocabulary.</p>

        <p>This was my first experiment with Replit.</p>

        <p>It began with paper and water and ended as a wacky animation.</p>

        <p>But your banana could be anything‚Äîa phrase you can‚Äôt get out of your head, a single sentence, a memory, a sketch on a napkin, or a challenge at work. If you want to turn it into something real, send me a note.</p>

          <p>Let‚Äôs build your banana.</p>
